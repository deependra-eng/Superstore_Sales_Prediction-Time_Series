# Superstore_Sales_Prediction-Time_Series

**Exploring the 'Superstore Sales' Dataset**: Explore the dataset to understand its structure, variables, and patterns.

**Installing and Importing Required Libraries**: Install and import the necessary libraries and packages for data analysis and modeling, such as pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, statsmodels, etc.

**Downloading the Dataset**: Download the 'Superstore Sales' dataset and load it into your programming environment.

**Understanding the Data**: Analyze the dataset to understand the variables, data types, and any missing values or outliers.

**Hypothesis Generation**: Generate hypotheses about the relationships, patterns, and trends present in the data based on your domain knowledge.

**Visualizing the Time Series**: Plot the time series data to visualize trends, patterns, seasonality, and any observations of interest.

**Set Time Index**: Set the time index of the dataset to facilitate time-based analysis and modeling.

**Time Resampling**: Resample the time series data to a different time frequency, such as converting daily data to monthly or annual data, to analyze different time granularities.

**Visualizing Trend, Pattern, Seasonalities, and Observations**: Further analyze and visualize the time series by decomposing it into trend, seasonality, and residual components.

**Testing for Stationarity**: Apply statistical tests like Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test to check the stationarity of the time series.

**Differencing and Transformation:** Perform differencing and transformations on the time series data to stabilize the mean and variance and make it stationary if required.

**Autocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation Analysis**: Analyze the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions to determine the order of autoregressive (AR) and moving average (MA) terms in the time series models.

**Preparing Time Series Dataset before Applying Models**: Preprocess the time series dataset by setting the time index, checking for white noise, handling missing values, normalizing or scaling the data, etc.

**Time Series Forecasting Models**: Apply the appropriate time series forecasting models such as AR, MA, ARMA, ARIMA, and SARIMA to forecast future values based on historical patterns and trends.

**Evaluation Metrics**: Use evaluation metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE) to assess the accuracy and performance of the forecasting models.
